## Preperation

We load the dataset (they are called `data.frame` in R), with the following code:

```{r read}
```

Lets pretend for a moment that it is enough to just load the data, because cleaning data and getting it into the right shape is 80% boring and 20% weird. 

```{r clean, include=FALSE}
```

We follow roughly the Book R for [Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) and therefore start with something more or less easy and rewarding: visualization!

## Data visualisation

The data.frame `mach` contains many intresting variables (which exactly can be found in the *codebook* under /data/raw/MACH_data/codebook.txt). One of them is `mach` (yes like the dataframe itself), which represents the average of answers to questions such as:

| ID | Statement                                                                                                       |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q1 | Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so.                               |
| Q2 | The best way to handle people is to tell them what they want to hear.                                           |
| Q3 | One should take action only when sure it is morally right.                                                      |
| Q4 | Most people are basically good and kind.                                                                        |
| Q5 | It is safest to assume that all people have a vicious streak and it will come out when they are given a chance. |

They represent a construct called ["Machiavellianism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism). How much they agree with 20 statements like the above, where indicated by `r nrow(mach)` people on a scale of 1-5.

With such data one can answer empirical questions like:

So is age related to Machiavellianism?

```{r}
ggplot(data = sample_n(mach, 500)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach))
```

You can create plots with the famous `ggplot2` library in the following way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

Data is the data.frame we are refering to, the geom function is the aesthetic (point for a scatter plot) and mapping descibes how the data relates do the geom. We can e.g. map the color of the points to the gender:

```{r}
# mach is simply to big so we choose randomly 500 persons
mini_mach <- sample_n(mach, 500)

ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach, color = gender))
```

Or the shape:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach, shape = gender))
```

If you want to set instead of map an aesthetic, it needs to go outside the `aes` function:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach), color = "darkred")
```

There are often more then one aestheticly pleasing aesthetics:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach))

ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach))
```

This last plot hides a lot more information but also tries to show the relation between age and mach. Combining the two may be powerfull:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mini_mach) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach))
```

So you can simply add more geoms with `+`. But also other things like a generel (possibly better locking theme). I like `theme_minimal`.

At the moment we have avoided overplotting by reducing the data to 500 people, but the use of the aesthetic `alpha` make more or less transparent points.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mach) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach), alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We still have a little problem with overplotting. The vertical stripes result from the fact that age is alway a round number, never e.g. a half. We can get rid of that with geom_jitter, with moves the points a little bit randomly around-

```{r}
ggplot(data = mach) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach), alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()
```

OK, so is this trend different for gender?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mach) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach, color = gender), alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Can you decipher what is going on with "other"-gender? I cannot. (Maybe you can solve that propblem; hint `facet_wrap` might help)

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mach) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mach, color = gender), alpha = .05) +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now try to build your personal intresting scatter plot?

(Hint: you may want to look into TIPI7 for a strong relationship)

```{r, include=FALSE}
select(mach, starts_with("TIPI")) %>%
  map(cor.test, mach$mach) %>% 
  map_dfr(broom::tidy, .id = "variable") %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(statistic))) %>% 
  select(variable, estimate, statistic) %>% 
  pander()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggplot(mach, aes(TIPI7, mach)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(mach, aes(TIPI2, mach)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(mach, aes(TIPI1, mach)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .05) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggplot(mach, aes(TIPI7, mach)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .05) +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
select(mach, starts_with("Q")) %>%
  map(as.character) %>% 
  map(chisq.test, mach$gender) %>% 
  map_dfr(broom::tidy, .id = "variable") %>% 
  arrange(desc(statistic)) %>% 
  pander()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
mach %>% 
  group_by(gender, Q9I) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Q9I, prop, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal()

mach %>% 
  filter(gender %in% c("m", "f")) %>% 
  group_by(gender, Q14I) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Q14I, prop, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal()
```
